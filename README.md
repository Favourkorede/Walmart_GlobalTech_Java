This task is to implement one of the proposed data structures: a slightly modified heap. The heap must satisfy the heap property, but rather than a traditional binary heap, each parent node in this heap will have 2^x children. The goal is to benchmark the most common operations on the data structure.

The requirements of the data structure are as follows:
The heap must satisfy the heap property.
Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children.
The value of x must be a parameter of the heapâ€™s constructor.
The heap must implement an insert method.
The heap must implement a pop max method.
The heap must be implemented in Java.
The heap must be performant.
